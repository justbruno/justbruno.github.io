For years I enjoyed a fruitful and edifying academic career. My research was focused on various aspects of Algorithms, Machine Learning and Data Science. My last position was as a Lecturer (Assistant Professor) of Computer Science at Queen Mary University of London.

Currently I am working in industry. I am enjoying the process of putting my theoretical knowledge to the test in practical, "real-world" problems. However, I try to remain active in research by staying in touch with my fellow academics and through personal projects.

An overview of my research:

- **Graph Mining**: I am interested in problems motivated by social networks, such as community detection, polarization and opinion formation. I tend to like spectral approaches. [NeurIPS '20](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2020/hash/7cc538b1337957dae283c30ad46def38-Abstract.html), [WWW '20](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.09410), [WWW '20](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.00775), [CIKM '19](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.02438).

- **Approximation Algorithms**: Recently, I have focused on constrained clustering, motivated by applications of algorithmic fairness and representation quotas. [KDD '22](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.07030), [ECML-PKDD '21](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.11696), [DAMI '22](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10618-021-00811-2), [WWW '19](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.10419).

- **Matrix Approximations**. I also focus on problems involving sampling and dimensionality reduction, and combinatorial optimization with a linear-algebraic flavor. [ICML '22](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v162/ordozgoiti22a.html), [WWW '21](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3442381.3450067), [Info. Sci. '19](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.04421.pdf), [ICDM '16](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7837863).

- **Machine Learning**. I have done work on areas of machine learning, such as kernel methods and deep learning applications. [ECML-PKDD '20](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.13567), [PLOS one '18](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0191939).

I also like to write <a href="/code/">efficient Python code</a> for fast prototyping and experimentation.

Don't hesitate to send me an e-mail if you want to work with me or discuss any of my works.
