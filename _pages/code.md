<h2>Research code</h2>

<a href="https://github.com/justbruno/fast-kmedian">Fast k-median</a>:
An efficient implementation of a local search algorithm for $k$-median, using matrix operations to achieve 1000x speed-up over a naive textbook implementation.

<a href="https://github.com/justbruno/signed-graph-balance-checker">Signed graph balance check</a>:
Optimized BFS for checking whether a signed graph is balanced.

<a href="https://github.com/justbruno/off-the-grid/">Fast hyperparameter search for kernel clustering</a>:
Optimizing Gaussian kernel bandwidth for $k$-means clustering, using fast element-wise exponentiation operations. This is the code for our <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.13567">ECML-KDD '20 paper</a>.

<h2>Teaching code</h2>
<a href="https://github.com/brunez/dl_workshop_upm">Introductory Deep Learning workshop</a>:
When I was a Ph.D. student I taught a workshop to introduce udnergrads to Deep Learning. This repo contains the notebooks I used.

<a href="https://github.com/justbruno/signal_processing_notebook/blob/main/signal_processing.ipynb">Understanding the Discrete Fourier and Discrete Wavelet transforms.</a>:
A notebook I use in my lectures to help the students understand some signal processing basics.
